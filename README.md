## Development

1. Clone this repo:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/artginzburg/flightnotifier
```
2. Launch the [mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/) locally
3. Run `npm i` in the root folder
> That also creates the `.env` file that you should fill with the environment variables listed in `.env.schema` (or `.env.defaults`)
4. Run `npm start`
